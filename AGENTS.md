# Project architecture

- Keep the Hayom Yom corpus bundled in `src/data/hayom-yom.ts` and derive Hebrew dates with `Intl`; this preserves offline reading without reusing the APK's restricted date-conversion code.
- Keep the Chants corpus bundled in `src/data/chants.json` and share it through `ChantsPage`; this preserves the complete first-party songbook independently of the former microsite.
